# hike-responsive-view
A public project to create responsive capabilities to hiking profiles.

I have a project which I'd like to become a local guide for Washington DC area hikers.  Right now, I have the front end of the web version ready with good cross-browser compatability.  However, I'd like to add the front-end code to make this responsive.  Responsive design is new to me, so I'm fascinated with the ability to make this page look good across a large variety of screens while using the same page.

I'd also like to learn more about responsive design, including cool tips and tricks!
